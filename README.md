# Honk of the Fates (final project ECE 167)

The goal of this project is to run a playable game of rock-paper-sissors crossed with laser tag. 

## Setup

The project requires at least two STM32 boards with the proper components attached and an Apple or Linux computer running a modern OS.
Our repo contains all of the necessary files except for the Python library which must be installed from Adafruit.

Install the Adafruit library from: 

## Usage

Run the python script on your laptop and power on the STM32 boards as well as the RGB LEDs (which must be powered off of a separate USB power source to get enough current at 5V)
